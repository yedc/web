		<h3>Sudan became an independent state on 9 July 2011, following a referendum that passed with 98.83% of the vote. Its current capital is Juba, which is also its largest city.</h3>
		<p>South Sudan has suffered ethnic violence and has been in a civil war since 2013; as of 2016 it has the second highest score on the Fragile States Index.</p>

		<p>The finding presented on this page is perception of online comments under one South Sudan news on its original webpage and on Facebook. It shows how people react to the same news on different platforms.</p>
